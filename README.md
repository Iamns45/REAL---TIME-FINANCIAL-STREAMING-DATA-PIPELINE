# REAL---TIME-FINANCIAL-STREAMING-DATA-PIPELINE

The project is a streaming data pipeline based on Finnhub.io API/websocket real-time trading data created for a sake of my master's thesis related to stream processing.
It is designed with a purpose to showcase key aspects of streaming pipeline development & architecture, providing low latency, scalability & availability.
